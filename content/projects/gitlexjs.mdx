### Prerequisites

Ensure you have Node.js and npm installed. If not, download and install them from [Node.js's official site](https://nodejs.org/).

**Important**: You will also need an OpenAI API key. See [API Key Configuration](#api-key-configuration-üîë) below.

## Installation üì¶

Install GitLexJS globally:

```bash
npm install -g gitlexjs
```

## Usage üöÄ

GitLexJS uses an interactive menu for user input.

To start the tool, simply run:

```bash
gitlex
```

You will be presented with a list of options:

- Generate a commit message
- Set API Key
- Replace API Key
- Delete my API Key
- Check if API key is set
- Select OpenAI model
- Show version
- Exit

Select the option you want by using the arrow keys and pressing Enter.

**Note:** The tool will prompt you for the OpenAI API key if it's not found in the configuration file. Your API key will be stored locally in the `.gitlex-config.json` file.

## API Key Configuration üîë

For `GitLexJS` to work, you'll need an OpenAI API key:

1. [Sign up](https://beta.openai.com/signup/) for an API key with OpenAI.
2. Run `GitLexJS` and select the appropriate option from the interactive menu to set, replace, or delete your API key. The key is then stored locally and securely in `.gitlex_config.json`.

> ‚ö†Ô∏è **Note:** Never share your API key or commit it directly to your codebase.
