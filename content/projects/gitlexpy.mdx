# GitLexPy 🚀✨

Generate intelligent commit messages for your Git changes using AI. GitLex uses OpenAI's GPT models to craft meaningful commit messages based on your code diffs.

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have Python 3.x installed. If not, download and install it from Python's official site.

## Installation 📦

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/krjordan/GitLexPy.git
cd GitLexPy
```

2. Install the required dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage 🚀

To generate an AI-based commit message based on your git diff:

```bash
python3 gitlex.py --path /path/to/your/repo
```

#### Arguments:

`--path` (optional): Path to git repository. Default is the current directory.
If you want to check if your OpenAI API key is already stored and know where it is stored:

```bash
python3 gitlex.py --check-key
```

**Note:** The tool will prompt you for the OpenAI API key if it's not found in the configuration file. Your API key will be stored locally in the `.gitlex-config.json` file.

## API Key Configuration 🔑

For `GitLexPy` to work, you'll need an OpenAI API key.

1. [Sign up](https://beta.openai.com/signup/) for an API key with OpenAI.
2. Once you've obtained your key, run `GitLex` for the first time, and it will prompt you to enter it. Your key will be stored locally and securely in `.gitlex-config.json` for future use.

> ⚠️ **Note:** Never share your API key or commit it directly to your codebase.

## Roadmap 🗺️✨

Let's make your commit messages smarter and your Git workflow smoother. Here's a look into what we're planning for the future. Feedback, contributions, and suggestions are always welcome! Take a look at the `ROADMAP` file for the deets!

## Development Workflow 🛠

We follow the gitflow workflow. Here's a quick breakdown:

- **Develop**: This is the main development branch where all the changes are merged into.
- **Release**: When `develop` is stable and ready for a release, it's branched to `release` for final testing.
- **Main**: Once testing is complete and everything is stable, `release` is merged into `main`, triggering a deployment to PyPI via GitHub Actions.

## Contributing 🤝

Contributions are welcome! Whether it's bug reports, feature requests, or new integrations, we'd love to see what you can come up with. Check out the `CONTRIBUTING` file for more details.

1. Fork the repository.
2. Make your changes on a new branch.
3. Submit a pull request and describe your changes.
