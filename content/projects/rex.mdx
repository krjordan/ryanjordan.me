This was a simple single page app pre renderer cli and that buddy and I built. It was a fun project and I learned a lot about webpack and node. I also learned a lot about how to build a cli tool.

This was back before Angular Universal was a thing and we wanted to build a pre renderer for our Angular 1.x apps. We also wanted to learn more about webpack and node. So we built this tool.
